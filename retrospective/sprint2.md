RETROSPECTIVE - TEAM 9
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics
- Number of stories committed vs done: 6 (5 + non Story) / 4
- Total points committed vs done: 3+3+3+5+2 / 3+3+3 => 16 / 9
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team)
- Estimated: 57h 30m
- Logged: 59h 5m

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    11   |    -   |  44h 15m   |   33h 55m    |
| _#1_   |    3    |    3   |    5h      |   9h 10m     |
| _#2_   |    2    |    3   |  1h 45m    |   7h 30m     |
| _#3_   |    3    |    3   |  6h 30m    |   8h 30m     |

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
Average = 59h 05m/19 = 3h 6m  
Standard Deviation: 1.8139323836684

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table

Task estimation error ratio = 57h 30m /59h 5m =0.9732

## QUALITY MEASURES
- Unit Testing:
 - Total hours estimated: 5h 15m
 - Total hours spent: 15h 40m
 - Nr of automated unit test cases: 17 (DAO) + 2 (server)
 - Coverage (if available): 57%
- E2E testing:
 - Total hours estimated: 0
 - Total hours spent: 0
- Code review
 - Total hours estimated: 12h
 - Total hours spent: 12h 
- Technical Debt management:
 - Total hours estimated :0h
 - Total hours spent : 0h
 - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube: 2h 25m
 - Hours spent on remediation : 0h
 - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability"): 0.5
 - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ):
	- Reliability: A
	- Security: A
	- Maintainability: A

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
	- Practicing with React and Nodejs took a lot of time, and we didn’t expect it
     - Testing

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
	- Positive: A better team organization and coordination skill
	- Negative: Underestimation of majority of tasks

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
	- Taking less stories in order to achieve better results (no uncompleted tasks, no tested tasks, etc)

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
	- We couldn’t spend time on technical debts because we hadn’t time for it due a lot of time spent for committed stories.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
	- Better completed tasks/time spent ratio
	- Spending more time on technical debts and code quality

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
	- We are proud of our members’ availability for meeting ( to fix and coordinate about problems ) as a team!
